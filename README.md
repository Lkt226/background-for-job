## Idea

The idea is create a job backscreen with a timer for pomodoro, in the job screen have a music, a timer and a to do list.

In stop screen, have fun actions (the initial idea is recomendeds videos on youtube max 5 minutes)

## APP in current moment

have a timer, but no config in GUI, modify time in const [getTime, setTime] = useState(->time<-)

i'm add a todo list 05/09 but not save, and don't stylized current.

to do list, semi complete, i not customize he, but add, remove and update in firebase.

if your need multiples todos, use ", " or add one for one.

for default the timer is paused, click in start for iniciate the timer.
