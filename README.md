## Idea

The idea is create a job backscreen with a timer for pomodoro, in the job screen have a music, a timer and a to do list.

In stop screen, have fun actions (the initial idea is recomendeds videos on youtube max 5 minutes)

## APP in current moment

have a timer, but no config in GUI, modify time in const [getTime, setTime] = useState(->time<-)

i'm add a todo list 05/09 but not save, and don't stylized current.

to do list, semi complete, i not customize he, but add, remove and update in firebase.

if your need multiples todos, use ", " or add one for one.

for default the timer is paused, click in start for iniciate the timer.

11/09, i'm re-create components for more interactions, but not atualize the site for comparate, this is the site : https://forjob-project.web.app

13/09, site remodeled

## How to use

1. Clone this git
2. use npm start

or access: https://forjob-project.web.app

## Future ideas

1. 13/09 - add in list "\*clear room, badroom, car and roof"
   result(
   clear room
   clear badroom
   clear car
   clear roof
   )
2. 13/09 - add song in timer finish

3. 13/09 - send timer to header on break time

4. 13/09 - add modules on grid

5. 13/09 - create and add modules, online.

6. 14/09 - modules configs for diferents designs

7. 14/09 - add item on press Enter with input selected

### Notes

i'm add a todo list 05/09 but not save, and don't stylized current.

11/09, i'm re-create components for more interactions, but not atualize the site for comparate, this is the site : https://forjob-project.web.app

13/09, site remodeled, styled, more interative and intuitive. but i need ideas for teaching uses, like uses "," for multiples todo or click in text for mark checked.
